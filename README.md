This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is this repository ?

I wrote this code to explain redux during a react peer learning session.

The goal was to explain what is redux and react-redux.

In this repository you'll find three examples:

-   AppWithState: a classic React App using state and setState

-   AppWithRedux: using the redux architecture to manage the application state

-   AppWithReactRedux: using react-redux and the context API to bind the redux store to react.

For each file, You'll find a explanation and the code implementation with each apis.
